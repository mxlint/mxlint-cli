Documentation: "What does this JavaScript action do?\r\n\r\nAfter you have uploaded
  an image it removes locally stored image from memory. This is a custom build action.\r\n\r\nDependency
  Note: \r\nThis JavaScript action should be used only when you have inserted the
  Image Upload JavaScript Action called 'JS_UploadAndConvertToFileBlobURL' into your
  nanoflow.\r\n\r\nMore detailed explanation:  Memory management.\r\n\r\nTo upload
  a image we use a custom build Javascript action called  'JS_UploadAndConvertToFileBlobURL'.\r\nInside
  this action we use a JavaScript method called createObjectURL() to upload and store
  files in local memory. We can access and cosume this in memory image resource via
  the URL path that is returned from the createObjectURL() method. \r\n\r\nHowever,
  each time you call createObjectURL(), a new object is created in memory, even if
  you've already created one for the same object. \r\nSo each of these must be released
  by calling this action called 'JS_RevokeUploadedFileFromMemory' when you no longer
  need them.\r\n\r\nBrowsers will release object URLs automatically when the document
  is unloaded; however, for optimal performance and memory usage, if there are safe
  times when you can explicitly unload them, you should do so with the JavaScriptAction
  called 'JS_RevokeUploadedFileFromMemory'."
