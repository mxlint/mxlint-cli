• Run \`react-native link @react-native-community/geolocation\` in the project root.
• Rebuild and re-run the app.
• If you are using CocoaPods on iOS, run \`pod install\` in the \`ios\` directory and then rebuild and re-run the app. You may also need to re-open Xcode to get the new pods.
If none of these fix the issue, please open an issue on the Github repository: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-geolocation`);
