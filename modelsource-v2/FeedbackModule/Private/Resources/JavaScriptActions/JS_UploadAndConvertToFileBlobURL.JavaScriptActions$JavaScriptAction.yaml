Documentation: "What does this JavaScript Action do?\r\n\r\nThis is a custom build
  JavaScript Action that triggers the file upload dialog box to open in your internet
  browser. \r\n\r\nDependency Note: \r\nThis JavaScript action should be used with
  the JavaScript Action called 'JS_RevokeUploadedFileFromMemory' so that the image
  uploaded is removed from local memory :)\r\n\r\nExplanation of this JavaScript Action
  & Memory management.\r\n\r\nWe use createObjectURL() to upload and store files in
  local memory. We can access and cosume this in memory image resource via the URL
  path that is returned from the createObjectURL() method. \r\n\r\nHowever, each time
  you call createObjectURL(), a new object is created in memory, even if you've already
  created one for the same object. \r\nSo each of these must be released by calling
  the JS Action called 'JS_RevokeUploadedFileFromMemory' when you no longer need them.\r\n\r\nBrowsers
  will release object URLs automatically when the document is unloaded; however, for
  optimal performance and memory usage, if there are safe times when you can explicitly
  unload them, you should do so with the JavaScriptAction called 'JS_RevokeUploadedFileFromMemory'."
